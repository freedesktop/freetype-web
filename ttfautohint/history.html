          <h4>11th February 2014</h4>

          <p>I proudly present the first release candidate for
            version 1.00!  Its main improvement is the use of the
            <a href="http://harfbuzz.org">HarfBuzz</a> library to
            handle OpenType features, allowing the hinting of glyphs
            that don't have an entry in a font's &lsquo;cmap&rsquo;
            table, for example superscripts or small caps.
            ttfautohint can now hint basically all glyphs of a
            supported script.</p>

          <p>Another improvement is much better GDI ClearType hinting
            in the range 30-80ppem (approx.), avoiding overly flat
            tops and bottoms of round glyphs.  The list of the
            remaining changes can be
            found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/1.00rc1/">here</a>.</p>


          <h4>9th November 2013</h4>

          <p>Version 0.97 is now available.  It comes with new support
            for the Hebrew script and improved handling of Cyrillic
            and Greek, which are no longer handled together with
            Latin.  This brings ttfautohint a big step nearer to
            version 1.0, which is scheduled to be released in the end
            of this year.</p>

          <p>The list of other changes can be
            found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/0.97/">here</a>.</p>

          <h4>7th August 2013</h4>

          <p>I'm happy to announce release 0.96.  Its main purpose is
            to fix the &lsquo;exploding outlines&rsquo; issue which
            happens on some printers
            (see <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/0.96/">here</a>
            for more), however, it also contains minor hinting
            improvements.</p>

          <p>The major work on FreeType (integration of a new CFF
            hinter contributed by Adobe and color support contributed
            by Google) has been done, so I can now fully return to
            ttfautohint development.  I expect to have the
            long-awaited support for more scripts implemented until
            October so that I can announce it during the ATypI
            conference in Amsterdam.</p>


          <h4>8th March 2013</h4>

          <p>Today I've released version 0.95.  This is a small
            maintenance release without major news
            (see <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/0.95/">here</a>
            for more).</p>

          <p>Currently, I'm heavily working on FreeType (including
            payed work) without having much time to continue the
            development of ttfautohint.  I estimate that this dormant
            phase will end in about two months, so stay tuned!</p>


          <h4>28th November 2012</h4>

          <p>This time, I have two issues to talk about:</p>

          <ul style="list-style: circle">
            <li>
              <p>Version 0.94 is out.  It adds two new options to
                better control the vertical dimensions of hinted
                glyphs to avoid clipping on Windows in case
                the <tt>usWinAscent</tt> and <tt>usWinDescent</tt>
                values from the font's &lsquo;OS/2&rsquo; table can't
                be adjusted (for whatever reasons).  As usual,
                look <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/0.94/">here</a>
                for more information.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>In the last twelve months, there was a lot of
                progress in the development of ttfautohint.  However,
                there is still a large list of improvements I would
                like to work on so that this tool becomes more
                versatile and useful.  To make this happen I start
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160331223853/https://pledgie.com/campaigns/15816">a
                  new funding drive</a>, and I ask you for financial
                  support!</p>
            </li>
          </ul>


          <h4>10th October 2012</h4>

          <p>Here comes version 0.93, right in time for the talk given
            by <a href="mailto:dave@understandingfonts.com">Dave
            Crossland</a> and <a href="mailto:eben@eyebytes.com">Eben
            Sorkin</a> at
            the <a href="https://www.atypi.org/conferences/hong-kong-2012/programme/11-oct-type-technologies-workshops/activity?a=148">atypi
            conference in Hong Kong!</a></p>

          <p>On the functionality side, it brings
            a <a href="doc/ttfautohint.html#hint-with-components">new
            option</a> to hint composite glyphs differently, greatly
            reducing the bytecode size of the created hints.  I'm
            waiting for reports whether this option works for most
            fonts; in case this is true I'll make it the default.  So
            please test!</p>

          <p>The list of other changes can be
            found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/0.93/">here</a>.
            Among other things, the GUI version of ttfautohint has a
            new layout (based on suggestions
            from <a href="mailto:frederik@typemytype.com">Frederik
            Berlaen</a>).</p>

          </div>


          <h4>7th August 2012</h4>

          <p>I've found quite an embarassing bug in the bytecode
            produced by ttfautohint, causing bad rounding.  All users
            should upgrade to version 0.92.</p>


          <h4>12th July 2012</h4>

          <p>Version 0.91 is out!  This mainly brings better support
            for GDI ClearType.  For other, minor improvements, please
            go
            to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/0.91/">this
            page</a> for more.</p>


          <h4>7th June 2012</h4>
          <p>After a long hiatus due to personal reasons, followed by
            intensive work on
            the <a href="doc/ttfautohint.html">documentation</a>, I'm
            happy to release version 0.9.</p>

          <p>While I was able to significantly reduce the generated
            bytecode, the GDI issues haven't been solved yet,
            unfortunately, to be fixed in a forthcoming release.  For
            other, minor improvements, please go
            to <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/0.9/">this
            page</a> for more.</p>


          <h4>6th April 2012</h4>

          <p>Thanks to a very generous donation from
            <a
            href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130809065321/http://blog.webink.com/extensis-webink-funds-open-source-ttfautohint-better-fonts-on-screen/">Extensis
              WebINK</a>,
              my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160331223853/https://pledgie.com/campaigns/15816">pledgie
              campaign</a> has reached its goal.  Kudos to all of you
              who have donated and supported me!</p>

          <p>In a few weeks I'll do a new release; this time with
            smaller output fonts due to a reduced size of the
            generated bytecode, and with better support for GDI
            ClearType.</p>


          <h4>30th March 2012</h4>

          <p>This page now uses
            the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a>
            font for display.</p>

          <p>Karsten L&uuml;cke again provided

          <h4>5th February 2012</h4>

          <p>Version 0.7 is available &ndash; we have a GUI!</p>

          <p>The Qt framework is used to provide a uniform interface
            for all supported platforms.</p>

          <p><a href="#download">Below</a> you can find a link for
            downloading Windows binaries.  If you want to have better
            installation support (including a package for Mac), please
            donate!</p>


          <h4>2nd January 2012</h4>

          <p>Version 0.6.1 is available.</p>

          <p>This release should fix problems with version 0.6;
            additionally, dropout mode has been activated.</p>


          <h4>25th December 2011</h4>

          <p>My Xmas present to you: version 0.6.  Thanks to all of
            you who are still donating!</p>

          <p>This version greatly improves handling of composite
            glyphs.  It also implements option <tt>-p</tt> to pre-hint
            a font with the original hints before processing it.</p>


          <h4>19th November 2011</h4>

          <p>Karsten L&uuml;cke provided a
            <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/0.5/ttfautohint-0.5-osx/download">static
              binary for OS&nbsp;X</a> &ndash; no need to install
              FreeType!  It was generated under version 10.5.8, but
              should run with version 10.7 also.</p>


          <h4>9th November 2011</h4>

          <p>The <a href="https://fonts.google.com">Google Web
              Fonts</a> has contributed an additional $3,000!  I have
              now raised two thirds of my goal!</p>

          <p>I hope other corporate font developers, especially those
            with large font catalogs, who will benefit substantially
            from this work, will consider making a contribution of a
            thousand dollars.</p>

          <p>I have just released version 0.5, including a Windows binary.
            <a href="https://repo.or.cz/w/ttfautohint.git/blob/HEAD:/TODO">You
              can read the project roadmap here.</a></p>


          <h4>18th October 2011</h4>

          <p>In September we have raised over $2,000 from the public,
            $7,000 each from Google and
            <a href="https://www.fontlab.com">FontLab</a>, together
            with a copy of FontLab&nbsp;5, and received from Microsoft
            the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/typography/tools/vtt.htm">
            Visual TrueType</a> file format specification.  This will
            allow designers to refine ttfautohint's results further
            using VTT, if I reach my $30,000 goal!</p>

          <p>The collected money so far enables me to intensively work
            on ttfautohint for the next three months.  The two main
            issues I'm going to handle are</p>

          <ul style="list-style: circle">
            <li>
              <p>fixing the bytecode to make it work reliably with
                Apple's TrueType engines (I've already started with
                that, and I estimate to provide a new release in about
                two weeks)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>writing a GUI for easier control</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>In case you have special wishes, now it's the right time
            to tell me!  Please look into
            the <a href="https://repo.or.cz/w/ttfautohint.git/blob/HEAD:/TODO"><tt>TODO</tt></a>
            file and check whether your idea is already covered!</p>
