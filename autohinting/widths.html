<h2>Introduction & Background:</h2>

<p>One of the primary purpose of grid-fitting is to ensure that some important
   features are preserved. One of them, if not the most important, is keeping
   the widths and heights of stems consistent on each character pixel size.</p>

<p>A naive approach would grid-fit each stem width by simply rounding it,
   independently of other consideration. However, this can create visible
   inconsistencies at small pixel sizes, when two stem widths that are close
   in pixel space become visibly distant due to the thresholding in the
   rounding process. This artefact is indeed very similar to the one that
   requires specific treatments in blue zones.</p>

<p>This problem is illustrated by the following picture:</p>

<p>As you can see, incoherent stems are really difficult to bear when reading
   text.</p>

<h2>Standard widths and heights</h2>

<p>The classical ways of dealing with this problem, as described in the Type 1
   font format specification is to choose one or more "standard" widths that
   will serve as references in pixel space when computing the pixel dimensions
   of stems.</p>
   
<p>It merely consists in two phases:</p>

<p><ul>
  <li><p>First, at design time, an histogram of the stem widths and heights
         of all font glyphs is built, and peaks are detected (through any
         given thresholding method). The median of each peak is stored within
         the font file in a list of "standard stem widths".</p>

  <li><p>During alignment control, each standard width is scaled and rounded to
         integer pixel coordinates. Then, for each glyph, stem widths and
         heights are compared to the standard ones in pixel space. If
         they are sufficiently close, the stem's width is snapped to the
         pixel standard width. Otherwise, it is rounded normally.</p>
</ul></p>

<p>This scheme works as long as the standard widths and heights stored in
   the font are coherent and meaningful. However, there is no way to extract
   this information from many other formats, including TrueType. We thus
   need a fast way to compute standard widths on-the-fly.</p>

<p>To do it, we simply re-compute the standard width, or an
   approximation of it, each time a new face is loaded in the auto-hinter.
   This is done very simply by loading a few well-known characters like
   the "O", "o", "I", "i", "Z", "z" and taking the size of their largest
   stems.</p>

<h2>Width normalisation</h2>

<p>Once the standard widths are computed in the master space, we can scale
   them to the current pixel grid, and round them to integer pixel widths.</p>
   
<p>When aligning edges, we compute the scaled width of stems and compare it
   to the (unaligned) standard widths. If a stem width is sufficiently close
   to a given standard width (using a typical threshold of a half pixel),
   its is snapped to the rounded standard width.</p>
   
<p>However, if the stem width is not close enough to one of the standard
   widths in pixel space, it needs to be aligned. A first implementation
   consists in simply rounding its pixel width to an integer. However, this
   sometimes creates unpleasant artefacts, that are much rarer than the
   discepency demonstrated in the introduction picture.</p>

<p>These artefacts are rare, usually appear for a single point size which
   varies with the font, but still exist. A general principle of coherency
   is that <em>it is better to be wrong by 10% all the time</em> than
   <em>completely correct in 95% cases, and greatly wrong in 5% cases</em>.</p>

<p>To avoid these problem while following the coherency principle, we
   essentially change the rounding threshold depending on the position of the
   stem width compared to its closest standard width.</p>

<p>For example, if the stem width is greater than its closest standard width,
   we use a rounding threshold of 3/4 instead of 1/2. Similarely, if it is
   lower than the closest standard width, we use a treshold of 1/4, like
   in:</p>
   
<pre>
    if (width > closest)
       width = (width+16) & -64;
       
    else if (width < closest)
       width = (width+40) & -64;
</pre>
   
<p>Of course, a similar choice is performed when the stem is under the
   standard width. We thus have a way of making stem widths slightly
   closer to the standard width, and avoid most artefacts this way.</p>
   
<p>XXX : An alternative implementation could consist in moving the stem
         width towards the standard width, using the delta that was used
         to grid-fit the latter when it is in the right direction.</p>

<p>XXX : Yet another alternative implementation could also try to move
         the stem width closer by a fixed distance (like a half pixel)
         then round it later.</p>
