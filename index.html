          <div class="date">2015-11-30, contributed by Nikolaus
            Waxweiler, updated 2015-12-08</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.6.2 ships with three interesting details for
            users and developers of rendering libraries that deal with
            text.</p>

                subpixel rendering has been changed</a></li>
          </ul>


          <h5 id="slight-hinting">(S)light hinting invokes the native
            hinter if possible</h5>

          <p>In the past, setting &lsquo;slight&rsquo; hinting via
            <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/">FontConfig</a>
            or configuration GUIs meant that native hints within a
            font were ignored; FreeType's auto-hinter would analyze
            the font on the fly and automatically do what the font
            designer would have to do at least semi-manually.
            Technically, the auto-hinter set to (s)light snaps glyphs
            to the pixel grid only vertically, just like Microsoft's
            DirectWrite/ClearType and Adobe's proprietary font engine.
            The result is a compromise between design fidelity and
            sharpness that preserves inter-glyph spacing, something
            very important for horizontal text such as what you are
            reading right now.  The sharpness has usually been
            enhanced with &lsquo;subpixel rendering&rsquo; (ClearType
            on Windows), exploiting the physical properties of modern
            but low-resolution LCD panels.</p>

          <p>This worked out well so far, Ubuntu has been using this
            setting for every font for years now.  Werner Lemberg is
            adding support for more and more scripts and has also spun
            off the code
            into <a href="http://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/">ttfautohint</a>,
            to help font designers ease the pain of manual
            hinting.</p>

          <p>This also meant that the native hinting machinery of the
            font drivers went unused.  Historically, this decision was
            sound because the native hinting mechanics for Postscript
            (<code>.pfa</code>, <code>.pfb</code>), TrueType
            (<code>.ttf</code>) and OpenType/CFF (<code>.otf</code>)
            were subpar for the longest time.  The PostScript hinter
            still is, but with Adobe's high-quality OpenType/CFF
            engine contributed to FreeType and recent advances of the
            TrueType driver towards full ClearType support, things
            have changed.</p>

          <p>Setting &lsquo;slight&rsquo; hinting usually leads to
            <code>FT_LOAD_TARGET_LIGHT</code>.  This mode implied the
            auto-hinter before and has now been changed to mean
            &ldquo;Use native vertical-grid-only-snapping if driver
            and font supports it and vertical-grid-only auto-hinter
            otherwise&rdquo;. Right now, only the OpenType/CFF driver
            is supported.  In the future, this will hopefully include
            the TrueType engine once full support for ClearType
            arrives.</p>

          <p>This decision was driven by my personal whim; I wanted
            native vertical grid-fitting if the font driver and font
            supports it, and the auto-hinter otherwise.  I assume that
            native hints are made more carefully and take the
            (auto-hinting) guesswork out of the process.  Instead of
            introducing per-format configuration in FontConfig and
            fighting <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a>/<a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>
            that only support a single global hinting setting, it was
            found to make more sense to change the definition of light
            hinting in FreeType.</p>

          <p>I also hope this change will make it easier for the
            non-Windows-and-Apple ecosystem to switch over to slight
            hinting as the default.  Current full/medium native
            hinting, as is the default, tends to bring out the worst
            in many, many fonts that haven't seen the same insane
            dedication to on-screen display and hinting as many
            popular Microsoft fonts, for example. And since ClearType
            is still not fully supported, you usually get a very poor
            default experience.  Slight hinting gives a much better
            one, as Ubuntu has proven over the years.</p>


          <h5 id="stem-darkening">Experimental: Stem darkening for the
            auto-hinter</h5>

          <a href="image/freetype-262-autohinter-stem-darkening-demo1.png">
            <img src="image/freetype-262-autohinter-stem-darkening-demo1-thumbnail.jpg"
                 alt="Demonstration and comparison of the emboldening
                      autohinter."></a>

          <p>Stem darkening emboldens glyphs at smaller sizes to make
            them more readable on common low-DPI screens.  If this
            sounds familiar to you, that's because Adobe's CFF engine
            has been doing it since it was contributed in 2013.  You
            might have noticed that OpenType/CFF fonts (commonly
            suffixed <code>.otf</code>) like GNOME&nbsp;3's default UI
            font <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantarell_(typeface)">Cantarell</a>
            appear bolder and fuzzier than other fonts, at least until
            this release.  The auto-hinter can do the exact same thing
            now, it is just disabled by default.</p>

          <p>But why would you do this if small glyphs are already
            fairly readable?  It turns out that font rendering in the
            Linux ecosystem has been wrong since scalable fonts were
            introduced to it.  Text must be rendered with linear alpha
            blending and gamma correction, which no toolkit or
            rendering library do by default
            on <a href="http://www.x.org">X11</a>, even
            though <a href="http://www.qt.io/qt5-4/">Qt5</a>
            and <a href="https://skia.org/">Skia</a> (as used by
            Google Chrome and other browsers) can do it.</p>

          <h6>Background</h6>

          <p>First, to understand why they are required, you must know
            that when FreeType outputs a grayscale glyph image, it
            really outputs a coverage bitmap.  If a pixel is
            completely covered by a filled-in outline, the pixel is
            made 100% black (0% brightness, which is simply black).
            If a pixel is only 50% covered, the pixel is made 50%
            black (50% brightness or a middle shade of gray) and 0%
            covered means 0% black (100% brightness or white).  On
            high-DPI screens like on smartphones and tablets, the
            pixels are so small that the chance of being completely
            covered and therefore completely black is fairly good.  On
            low-DPI screens most of us are sadly stuck with, the
            situation is different.  The pixels are too large for most
            of the details of a glyph and shades of gray are the norm
            rather than the exception.</p>

          <p>This is relevant because all our screens have a second
            problem: they are not linear.  1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 is
            not&nbsp;2.  Twice the value does not result in twice the
            brightness.  When a pixel is only 50% covered, the
            coverage map says 50% black, and this translates to a
            pixel value of 128 when you use 8&nbsp;bits per channel
            (0-255).  However, this does not translate to 50%
            brightness for that pixel on our sRGB and gamma 2.2
            screens.  Due to their non-linearity, they dwell longer in
            the darks and only a pixel value of about 186 results in
            50% brightness &ndash; 128 ends up too dark on both bright
            and dark backgrounds.  The net result is that dark text
            looks burnt-out, pixely and blotchy on bright background,
            bright text too frail on dark backgrounds, and colored
            text on colored background (for example, red on green)
            seems to have dark halos or &lsquo;dirt&rsquo; around it.
            The situation is especially ugly for diagonal stems like
            in glyph &lsquo;w&rsquo;, where the quality of FreeType's
            anti-aliasing depends on the correct display of grays.  On
            high-DPI screens where smaller, fully black pixels reign
            supreme, this doesn't matter, but on our low-DPI screens
            with all the gray shades, it does.  0% and 100% brightness
            are the same things in linear and non-linear space, just
            all the shades in-between are not.</p>

          <p>The correct way of rendering a glyph image on a surface
            is
            to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing">alpha
            blend</a> it onto the surface in linear space and then
            apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction">gamma
            correction</a> to translate the linear coverage map to
            something that is correct for our
            screens.<a href="#ft-262-1">[1]</a> No toolkit in the
            Linux ecosystem does it by default, even though Qt5 and
            Skia can and will do it on other platforms.  Windows and
            Mac OS&nbsp;X do it natively.  This procedure is
            especially important if glyphs should be subpixel-rendered
            (ClearType and Mac OS&nbsp;X)
            with <a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/freetype-devel/2015-11/msg00020.html">as
            few color fringes as possible</a>.</p>

          <h6>Back to stem darkening</h6>

          <p>Assume we render fonts correctly.  Gamma correction
            essentially lightens fonts since shades of gray are
            shifted to higher pixel values (corresponding to higher
            brightness) to match the original intention to the reality
            of our screens.  The side-effect is that glyphs that were
            rendered incorrectly but fairly readable suddenly thin
            out.  Correctly rendered but hard-to-read text doesn't do
            anyone a favor.  So Mac OS&nbsp;X and Adobe's proprietary
            font engine implement a counter-measure: stem darkening at
            smaller sizes where shades of gray dominate.  By
            emboldening a glyph slightly in relation to its pixel
            size, individual pixels get higher coverage of filled-in
            outlines and are therefore blacker.  This increases
            contrast and prevents thinning out of glyphs.  Text
            remains readable at smaller sizes.</p>

          <a href="image/BlendingExamples.png">
            <img src="image/BlendingExamples-thumbnail.jpg"
                 alt="Comparison of different ways of blending."></a>

          <p>&ldquo;Gamma 1.0&rdquo; shows what happens when you take
          a grayscale coverage bitmap from FreeType and blend it onto
          a surface in linear space.  Black-on-white is heavier than
          white-on-black and red-on-green has dark halos or dirt
          around it.  Note that this picture is unrealistic in the
          sense that no rendering system on X11 does linear alpha
          blending, so imagine something worse.  &ldquo;Gamma
          1.8&rdquo; is the result of linear alpha
          blending <em>and</em> gamma correction.  It is much better,
          but text thins out, making it harder to read.  Adding stem
          darkening gets us to &ldquo;Gamma 1.8, darkened&rdquo;.
          Note how it is the cleanest rendering of all.  &ldquo;Gamma
          1.0, darkened&rdquo;, meaning linear alpha blending without
          gamma correction but with stem darkening, exaggerates the
          effects of &ldquo;Gamma 1.0&rdquo;.  Stem darkening should
          only be enabled when doing gamma correction, so ideally it
          should always be done.</p>

          <a href="image/freetype-262-autohinter-stem-darkening-demo2.png">
            <img src="image/freetype-262-autohinter-stem-darkening-demo2-thumbnail.jpg"
                 alt="Waterfall comparison of non-emboldening and
                      emboldening autohinter."></a>

          <p>The autohinter has a new toggleable stem darkening
            property that works like the stem darkener in Adobe's CFF
            engine.  Note how it makes text slightly bolder with the
            default parameters, down to small pixel sizes.  Gamma
            correction is active to demonstrate the thinning out of
            text especially at smaller pixel sizes with lots of gray
            pixels.</p>

          <p>And that is the story behind this feature.</p>


          <h5 id="disabled">Disabled stem darkening for the autohinter
            and Adobe's CFF (<code>.otf</code>) engine</h5>

          <p>No library supports linear alpha blending and gamma correction out
          of the box on X11. Turning on stem darkening leads to heavy and fuzzy
          looking glyphs as in &ldquo;Gamma 1.0, darkened&rdquo; above, so it's
          better to disable it.</p>

          <p>Qt5 actually had gamma correction enabled for a short
            time while until someone complained that text was too
            light and unlike rendering in other toolkits, so the
            maintainers <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-41590">disabled
            it for the XCB-backend</a>.  Skia (Chrome) can do
            gamma-correction, but turns it off for X11.</p>

          <p>I see autohinter stem darkening as a technology preview
            for playing around with until we get stem darkening
            generic within FreeType.  The plan is to provide it for
            all font drivers and make it toggable
            per <code>FT_Library</code> just like
            <code>FT_Library_SetLcdFilter</code>.  Libraries that
            support linear alpha blending and gamma correction can
            then just flip the switch and get appropriate glyphs no
            matter the font.</p>

          <p>A notable side-effect of disabling all stem darkening by
            default is that natively hinted <code>.otf</code> fonts
            will render remarkably similar to the auto-hinter and are
            no longer heavy and fuzzy.  Slight hinting will result in
            consistent font rendering.</p>


          <h5 id="lcd-filter">The default LCD filter for subpixel
            rendering has been changed</h5>

          <a href="image/freetype-262-new-old-filter.png">
            <img src="image/freetype-262-new-old-filter-thumbnail.jpg"
                 alt="Comparison of the old and new filter."></a>

          <p>When you look at subpixel-rendered text, no matter
            whether it is on some kind of Unix, Windows, or Mac
            OS&nbsp;X, you might notice that it is slightly colored.
            Using subpixel rendering on LCD panels is a trade-off; you
            get three times higher resolution in the direction of the
            pixel-substripe (usually horizontal RGB) in exchange for
            color artifacts, also called <em>color fringes</em>.  For
            this reason it is necessary to filter a subpixel-rendered
            glyph to reduce those color fringes before putting it
            somewhere on the screen.  The filter distributes the
            values of a subpixel to its neighbors, sacrificing some of
            the higher resolution and making the resulting glyph image
            blurrier, but the positioning improvement remains!  The
            ideal filter for you depends on your screen (gamma
            curves), the capabilities of the rendering system (linear
            alpha blending and gamma correction), your vision and your
            taste, probably in that order.</p>

          <p>A filter should have two properties: it should be
            normalized, meaning the values used in the filter should
            sum up to a figurative&nbsp;1 (here: 0x100 or 256) and it
            should be color-balanced, meaning that values for one
            subpixel are equally distributed to all other subpixels of
            a pixel to sacrifice some of the higher resolution to
            drastically reduce color fringes.</p>

          <p>Previously, FreeType's default LCD filter was neither
            normalized nor color-balanced.  That was a deliberate
            choice because there is still no rendering system on
            Unix-like operating systems that does linear alpha
            blending and gamma correction by default to render glyphs
            correctly.  Going above a filter sum of&nbsp;1 increased
            contrast somewhat at the expense of slight distortions and
            increased color-fringing, so this can be seen as a hack.
            You might have noticed that thumbnails in various places
            on your computer that show text could be quite colorful.
            Now you know why.</p>

          <p>The new default filter is both normalized and
            color-balanced.  It is indeed ever so slightly blurrier
            than the previous default one, but also lacks its
            harshness and is less color-happy.  The blurriness also
            means higher tolerance for non-ideal screen gamma (viewing
            angles) and rendering systems without linear alpha
            blending.  Note that color fringes can only be really
            minimized when the rendering system will do linear alpha
            blending of text.</p>

          <p>The &lsquo;light&rsquo; filter that has accompanied the
            default one for so long stays unchanged: it already is
            normalized and color-balanced.  It is sharper than the
            default one but less tolerant of uncalibrated screens and
            rendering systems without linear alpha blending, producing
            more color fringes.</p>

          <h4>FreeType 2.6.2</h4>
          <div class="date">2015-11-28</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.6.2 has been released.  This is a minor
            release that mainly provides better handling of malformed
            fonts.  All users should upgrade.</p>

          <p>A new feature is stem darkening support for the
            auto-hinter.  Note, however, that it is off by default,
            since most graphic systems don't provide correct linear
            alpha blending with gamma correction, which is crucial for
            a good appearance.  For the same reason, stem darkening
            for the CFF engine is now off by default, too.</p>

          <p>See
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6.2/">here</a>
            for a more detailed list of changes.</p>


          <h4>FreeType 2.6.1</h4>
          <div class="date">2015-10-04</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.6.1 has been released.  This is a minor
            release that corrects problems with CFF metrics, and that
            provides better handling of malformed fonts.  Two notably
            new features are auto-hinting support for the Lao script
            and a simple interface for accessing named instances in GX
            TrueType variation fonts.</p>

          <p>See
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6.1/">here</a>
            for a list of changes.</p>


          <h4>FreeType 2.6</h4>
          <div class="date">2015-06-08</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.6 has been released.  This is a new major
            release that provides a better (and simpler) thread-safety
            model.  Among other new features we now have auto-hinting
            support for Arabic and Thai, together with much improved
            handling of Apple's GX TrueType variation font format.</p>

          <p>See
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6/">here</a>
            for a list of changes.</p>


          <h4>FreeType 2.5.5</h4>
          <div class="date">2014-12-30</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.5.5 has been released.  This is a minor bug
            fix release: All users of PCF fonts should update, since
            version 2.5.4 introduced a bug that prevented reading of
            such font files if not compressed.</p>


          <h4>FreeType 2.5.4</h4>
          <div class="date">2014-12-06</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.5.4 has been released.  All users should
            upgrade due to another fix for vulnerability CVE-2014-2240
            in the CFF driver.  The library also contains a new round
            of patches for better protection against malformed
            fonts.</p>

          <p>The main new feature, which is also one of the targets
            mentioned in the pledgie roadmap below, is auto-hinting
            support for Devanagari and Telugu, two widely used Indic
            scripts.  A more detailed description of the remaining
            changes and fixes can be
            found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.4/">here</a>.</p>


          <h4>New Pledgie Campaign</h4>
          <div class="date">2014-03-11</div>

          <p>This is a call for a
            <a href="https://pledgie.com/campaigns/24434">new Pledgie
              campaign</a> to support my (Werner Lemberg) expenses in
            2014.  Thanks to all donors,
            the <a href="https://pledgie.com/campaigns/18808">last
              campaign</a> was successful, and all goals have been
            reached!</p>

          <p>If your company is using FreeType in your product, and
            you care about continuing support and further development,
            please contribute to my funding effort so I can continue
            to bring the best text rendering to your devices!</p>

          <p>Alternatively, direct donations to my PayPal account are
            also highly welcome&nbsp;<tt>:-)</tt></p>

          <h5>Roadmap</h5>

          <p>Besides user support and fixing bugs, your money will
            help me implement the following issues.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Setting up a test framework for FreeType.  This is a
              huge, long-term undertaking that will ensure both
              stability and reliability of the library.  The idea is
              to collect test cases (mainly broken fonts) that cover
              as much source code as possible.  Another idea to
              investigate is the development of scripts that can
              generate both valid and invalid input data to
              systematically increase the coverage of executed library
              code, including the unlikely cases.  Finally, images of
              valid, well-rendered input fonts could be collected: As
              soon as a change to the rendering image gets applied, a
              comparison run with those images should detect rendering
              regressions.</li>
            <li>Further improvements to the auto-hinter.  Right now,
              the module for Indic support is a dummy, and support for
              the family of Arabic scripts is completely
              missing. <span class="comment">[FreeType 2.6.1 comes
              with auto-hinting support for Devanagari, Telugu,
              Arabic, Thai, and Lao.]</span>  Both investigation and
              research is necessary to find out how much auto-hinting
              is possible and useful, and whether other, completely
              different scripts can be supported at all.</li>
            <li>Right now, rendering Type&nbsp;1 and CID-keyed fonts
              is the weakest part of FreeType.  However, we now have a
              brand-new module for handling CFF.  Given that CFF is
              very similar to Type&nbsp;1, it should be not too
              difficult to use and/or extend the CFF code so that
              Type&nbsp;1 fonts can be handled, too.</li>
            <li>Explore whether it makes sense to merge FreeType with
              (parts of)
              the <a href="http://harfbuzz.org">HarfBuzz</a> library.
              Since version 2.5.3, FreeType already links to HarfBuzz
              to use its abilities for scanning OpenType layout
              features, and more integration might be sensible for
              both libraries.</li>
            <li>More improvements to this website.  Last year I’ve
              redesigned the FreeType website.  However, a large bunch
              of documents are still using the old design, and some of
              them are also no longer up to
              date.  <span class="comment">[As with version 2.6.0, the
              FreeType Tutorial has been updated.]</span></li>
          </ul>


          <h4>FreeType 2.5.3</h4>
          <div class="date">2014-03-08</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.5.3 has been released.  All users should
            upgrade due to fixed vulnerability in the CFF driver
            (CVE-2014-2240).</p>

          <p>Its main new feature is much enhanced support of
            auto-hinting SFNT fonts (i.e., TrueType and CFF fonts) due
            to the use of
            the <a href="http://harfbuzz.org">HarfBuzz</a> library.  A
            more detailed description of this and other changes can be
            found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.3/">here</a>.</p>


          <h4>FreeType 2.5.2</h4>
          <div class="date">2013-12-08</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.5.2 has been released.  It fixes a serious bug
            introduced in version 2.5.1; all users should upgrade.</p>

          <p>A listing of the changes can be
          found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.2/">here</a>.</p>

          <h4>FreeType 2.5.1</h4>
          <div class="date">2013-11-25</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.5.1 has been released, providing three major
            new features.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Support for the WOFF font format, contributed by
              Behdad Esfahbod.</li>
            <li>The auto-hinter now supports Hebrew, together with
              improved support for Cyrillic and Greek.</li>
            <li>The directory layout of the (installed) FreeType
              header files has been simplified.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Among other changes I want to mention that FreeType's
            TrueType debugger (<tt>ttdebug</tt>) has been made more
            versatile.  An exhaustive list of changes can be
            found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.1/">here</a>.</p>

          <h4>Pledgie Campaign Was Successful!</h4>
          <div class="date">2013-06-25</div>

          <p>Thanks to a very generous donation by Pierre Arnaud
            from <a href="http://www.epsitec.ch">Epsitec</a>, the
            pledgie campaign for FreeType has reached its goal.  I
            want to say thank you again to all donors!  Of course,
            noone stops you from further donating to the campaign
            :-)</p>

          <p>After integration of Adobe's CFF module and Google's
            color emoji support, I will use the next months to work on
            the remaining issues that I've promised to implement.
            Stay tuned!</p>

          <h4>FreeType 2.5</h4>
          <div class="date">2013-06-19</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.5 has been released.  A major new feature is
            support for color embedded bitmaps (eg. color emoji),
            contributed by Behdad Esfahbod on behalf of Google.
            Additionally, Adobe's CFF engine is now the default, which
            makes a good reason to change from the 2.4.x to the 2.5.x
            series.</p>

          <p>On the technical side, the property API to access
          FreeType module parameters (<tt>FT_Property_Set</tt>
          and <tt>FT_Property_Get</tt>) is now declared as stable.</p>

          <p>As usual,
            see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.0/">this
            file</a> for the complete release notes, which give more
            details.  And we have again blog entries
            from <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2013/06/adobe-cff-font-rasterizer-accepted-by-freetype.html">Adobe</a>
            and <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/06/youve-got-cff.html">Google</a>.</p>

          <p>[Please download the 2.5.0.1 bundle of the FreeType
            library, which fixes a packaging error.]</p>

          <h4>FreeType 2.4.12</h4>
          <div class="date">2013-05-08</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.4.12 has been released.  A major new feature
            is a new parsing and hinting engine for CFF fonts,
            contributed by Adobe in collaboration with Google.  It was
            my job the last few months to fully adapt the code to
            FreeType, and we are very pleased with the results.  You
            might also read the blog entries from
            <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2013/05/adobe-contributes-cff-rasterizer-to-freetype.html">Adobe</a>
            and <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/05/got-cff.html">Google</a>.</p>

          <p>In connection with the new CFF engine, the demo programs,
            especially <tt>ftview</tt> and <tt>ftdiff</tt>, have been
            improved a lot; as usual, more details on the changes can
            be found in
            the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.4.12/">release
            notes</a>.</p>

          <p>I also want to say a big thank you to all the people who
            have already donated to the campaign!  In particular I
            want to thank Adobe, which has contributed to half the
            total pledgie amount.</p>

            it also contains important improvements:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>experimental support for TrueType subpixel hinting
              support, as documented in
              Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/truetypecleartype.aspx">whitepaper</a></li>

          <p>The website has been redesigned, giving it a more recent
            look to enhance readability and to make navigation easier.
            Note that only the two topmost levels have been changed
            yet; the remaining pages will follow.</p>

          <h4>FreeType 2.4.10</h4>
          <div class="date">2012-06-15</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.4.10 has been released.  This is minor
            release, fixing mainly a problem for GhostScript.
