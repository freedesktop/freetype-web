          <h4>FreeType 2.7.1</h4>
          <div class="date">2016-12-30</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.7.1 has been released.  The most important
            news is preliminary support of Adobe's new CFF2 font
            format and variation fonts as specified in the new
            OpenType specification version&nbsp;1.8.  It also fixes
            the handling of raw CID fonts (which might be found in PDF
            files)</p>

          <p>See
            <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.7.1/">here</a>
            for a list of changes.</p>


          <h4>FreeType 2.7</h4>
          <div class="date">2016-09-08</div>

          <p>We start a new &lsquo;minor&rsquo; series, which finally
            allows us to activate a new default mode for bytecode
            hinting (see also the announcements below for version
            2.6.4 and 2.6.5): Subpixel hinting, also known as
            ClearType hinting.</p>

          <p>In case you are already using subpixel hinting (for
            example, by using the &lsquo;Infinality patches&rsquo; as
            provided by some GNU/Linux or BSD distributions, or
            directly
            from <a href="https://bohoomil.com/">bohoomil.com</a>), be
            noted that the new mode might provide subtle differences;
            the code was simplified to make it <em>much</em> faster.
            If you are used to the old full-pixel hinting, you will
            see many rendering changes.  If you really dislike them,
            you can disable them at compile time or using the
            new <code>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</code> environment
            variable.</p>

          <p>A description of the remaining changes can be
            found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.7/">here</a>,
            as usual.</p>


          <h4>FreeType 2.6.5</h4>
          <div class="date">2016-07-12</div>

          <p>This release is almost identical to the previous version,
            with two differences.

            <ul>
              <li>It compiles again on Mac OS X, and</li>
              <li>it reverts the activation of subpixel hinting by
                default; it will be enabled by default in the
                forthcoming 2.7.x series.  Main reason for reverting
                this feature is the principle of least surprise: a
                sudden change in appearance of all fonts (even if the
                rendering improves for almost all recent fonts) should
                not be expected in a new micro version of a
                series.</li>
            </ul>


          <h4>FreeType 2.6.4</h4>
          <div class="date">2016-07-05</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.6.4 has been released.  The most important
            change is a new bytecode hinting mode for TrueType fonts
            that finally activates subpixel hinting (a.k.a. ClearType
            hinting) by default.</p>

          <p>The new release also brings support for the following new
            scripts in the auto-hinter: Armenian, Cherokee, Ethiopic,
            Georgian, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Sinhala, and
            Tamil.</p>

          <p>See
            <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6.4/">here</a>
            for a detailed list of changes.</p>


          <h4>FreeType 2.6.3</h4>
          <div class="date">2016-02-09</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.6.3 has been released.  It brings support for
            four new Asian scripts in the auto-hinter (Khmer, Myanmar,
            Kannada, and Bengali), together with other, minor
            improvements and bug fixes.</p>

          <p>See
            <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6.3/">here</a>
            for a detailed list of changes.</p>


          <h4>More on the 2.6.2 release for users and developers</h4>
          <div class="date">2015-11-30</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.6.2 ships with three interesting details for
            users and developers of rendering libraries that deal with
            text. <a href="freetype2/docs/text-rendering-general.html">Read
            more</a>.</p>


          <h4>FreeType 2.6.2</h4>
          <div class="date">2015-11-28</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.6.2 has been released.  This is a minor
            release that mainly provides better handling of malformed
            fonts.  All users should upgrade.</p>

          <p>A new feature is stem darkening support for the
            auto-hinter.  Note, however, that it is off by default,
            since most graphic systems don't provide correct linear
            alpha blending with gamma correction, which is crucial for
            a good appearance.  For the same reason, stem darkening
            for the CFF engine is now off by default, too.</p>

          <p>See
            <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6.2/">here</a>
            for a more detailed list of changes.</p>


          <h4>FreeType 2.6.1</h4>
          <div class="date">2015-10-04</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.6.1 has been released.  This is a minor
            release that corrects problems with CFF metrics, and that
            provides better handling of malformed fonts.  Two notably
            new features are auto-hinting support for the Lao script
            and a simple interface for accessing named instances in GX
            TrueType variation fonts.</p>

          <p>See
            <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6.1/">here</a>
            for a list of changes.</p>


          <h4>FreeType 2.6</h4>
          <div class="date">2015-06-08</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.6 has been released.  This is a new major
            release that provides a better (and simpler) thread-safety
            model.  Among other new features we now have auto-hinting
            support for Arabic and Thai, together with much improved
            handling of Apple's GX TrueType variation font format.</p>

          <p>See
            <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6/">here</a>
            for a list of changes.</p>


          <h4>FreeType 2.5.5</h4>
          <div class="date">2014-12-30</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.5.5 has been released.  This is a minor bug
            fix release: All users of PCF fonts should update, since
            version 2.5.4 introduced a bug that prevented reading of
            such font files if not compressed.</p>


          <h4>FreeType 2.5.4</h4>
          <div class="date">2014-12-06</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.5.4 has been released.  All users should
            upgrade due to another fix for vulnerability CVE-2014-2240
            in the CFF driver.  The library also contains a new round
            of patches for better protection against malformed
            fonts.</p>

          <p>The main new feature, which is also one of the targets
            mentioned in the pledgie roadmap below, is auto-hinting
            support for Devanagari and Telugu, two widely used Indic
            scripts.  A more detailed description of the remaining
            changes and fixes can be
            found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.4/">here</a>.</p>


          <h4>New Pledgie Campaign</h4>
          <div class="date">2014-03-11</div>

          <p>This is a call for a
            <a href="https://pledgie.com/campaigns/24434">new Pledgie
              campaign</a> to support my (Werner Lemberg) expenses in
            2014.  Thanks to all donors,
            the <a href="https://pledgie.com/campaigns/18808">last
              campaign</a> was successful, and all goals have been
            reached!</p>

          <p>If your company is using FreeType in your product, and
            you care about continuing support and further development,
            please contribute to my funding effort so I can continue
            to bring the best text rendering to your devices!</p>

          <p>Alternatively, direct donations to my PayPal account are
            also highly welcome&nbsp;<tt>:-)</tt></p>

          <h5>Roadmap</h5>

          <p>Besides user support and fixing bugs, your money will
            help me implement the following issues.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Setting up a test framework for FreeType.  This is a
              huge, long-term undertaking that will ensure both
              stability and reliability of the library.  The idea is
              to collect test cases (mainly broken fonts) that cover
              as much source code as possible.  Another idea to
              investigate is the development of scripts that can
              generate both valid and invalid input data to
              systematically increase the coverage of executed library
              code, including the unlikely cases.  Finally, images of
              valid, well-rendered input fonts could be collected: As
              soon as a change to the rendering image gets applied, a
              comparison run with those images should detect rendering
              regressions.</li>
            <li>Further improvements to the auto-hinter.  Right now,
              the module for Indic support is a dummy, and support for
              the family of Arabic scripts is completely
              missing. <span class="comment">[FreeType 2.6.1 comes
              with auto-hinting support for Devanagari, Telugu,
              Arabic, Thai, and Lao.]</span>  Both investigation and
              research is necessary to find out how much auto-hinting
              is possible and useful, and whether other, completely
              different scripts can be supported at all.</li>
            <li>Right now, rendering Type&nbsp;1 and CID-keyed fonts
              is the weakest part of FreeType.  However, we now have a
              brand-new module for handling CFF.  Given that CFF is
              very similar to Type&nbsp;1, it should be not too
              difficult to use and/or extend the CFF code so that
              Type&nbsp;1 fonts can be handled, too.</li>
            <li>Explore whether it makes sense to merge FreeType with
              (parts of)
              the <a href="http://harfbuzz.org">HarfBuzz</a> library.
              Since version 2.5.3, FreeType already links to HarfBuzz
              to use its abilities for scanning OpenType layout
              features, and more integration might be sensible for
              both libraries.</li>
            <li>More improvements to this website.  Last year Iâ€™ve
              redesigned the FreeType website.  However, a large bunch
              of documents are still using the old design, and some of
              them are also no longer up to
              date.  <span class="comment">[As with version 2.6.0, the
              FreeType Tutorial has been updated.]</span></li>
          </ul>


          <h4>FreeType 2.5.3</h4>
          <div class="date">2014-03-08</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.5.3 has been released.  All users should
            upgrade due to fixed vulnerability in the CFF driver
            (CVE-2014-2240).</p>

          <p>Its main new feature is much enhanced support of
            auto-hinting SFNT fonts (i.e., TrueType and CFF fonts) due
            to the use of
            the <a href="http://harfbuzz.org">HarfBuzz</a> library.  A
            more detailed description of this and other changes can be
            found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.3/">here</a>.</p>


          <h4>FreeType 2.5.2</h4>
          <div class="date">2013-12-08</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.5.2 has been released.  It fixes a serious bug
            introduced in version 2.5.1; all users should upgrade.</p>

          <p>A listing of the changes can be
          found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.2/">here</a>.</p>

          <h4>FreeType 2.5.1</h4>
          <div class="date">2013-11-25</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.5.1 has been released, providing three major
            new features.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Support for the WOFF font format, contributed by
              Behdad Esfahbod.</li>
            <li>The auto-hinter now supports Hebrew, together with
              improved support for Cyrillic and Greek.</li>
            <li>The directory layout of the (installed) FreeType
              header files has been simplified.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Among other changes I want to mention that FreeType's
            TrueType debugger (<tt>ttdebug</tt>) has been made more
            versatile.  An exhaustive list of changes can be
            found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.1/">here</a>.</p>

          <h4>Pledgie Campaign Was Successful!</h4>
          <div class="date">2013-06-25</div>

          <p>Thanks to a very generous donation by Pierre Arnaud
            from <a href="http://www.epsitec.ch">Epsitec</a>, the
            pledgie campaign for FreeType has reached its goal.  I
            want to say thank you again to all donors!  Of course,
            noone stops you from further donating to the campaign
            :-)</p>

          <p>After integration of Adobe's CFF module and Google's
            color emoji support, I will use the next months to work on
            the remaining issues that I've promised to implement.
            Stay tuned!</p>

          <h4>FreeType 2.5</h4>
          <div class="date">2013-06-19</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.5 has been released.  A major new feature is
            support for color embedded bitmaps (eg. color emoji),
            contributed by Behdad Esfahbod on behalf of Google.
            Additionally, Adobe's CFF engine is now the default, which
            makes a good reason to change from the 2.4.x to the 2.5.x
            series.</p>

          <p>On the technical side, the property API to access
          FreeType module parameters (<tt>FT_Property_Set</tt>
          and <tt>FT_Property_Get</tt>) is now declared as stable.</p>

          <h4>FreeType 2.4.12</h4>
          <div class="date">2013-05-08</div>

          <p>FreeType 2.4.12 has been released.  A major new feature
            is a new parsing and hinting engine for CFF fonts,
            contributed by Adobe in collaboration with Google.  It was
            my job the last few months to fully adapt the code to
            FreeType, and we are very pleased with the results.  You
            might also read the blog entries from
            <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2013/05/adobe-contributes-cff-rasterizer-to-freetype.html">Adobe</a>
            and <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/05/got-cff.html">Google</a>.</p>

          <p>In connection with the new CFF engine, the demo programs,
            especially <tt>ftview</tt> and <tt>ftdiff</tt>, have been
            improved a lot; as usual, more details on the changes can
            be found in
            the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.4.12/">release
            notes</a>.</p>

          <p>I also want to say a big thank you to all the people who
            have already donated to the campaign!  In particular I
            want to thank Adobe, which has contributed to half the
            total pledgie amount.</p>

          <h4>Pledgie Campaign for Development and Maintainance</h4>

          </a></p>

          <p>I've started a pledgie campaign for FreeType development
            and maintainance.  While no single company employs me
            (Werner Lemberg) directly to work on it, I am constantly
            improving it, adding new features, relentlessly driving up
            quality, and responding to other developersâ€™ requests.</p>

          <p>If you or your company is using FreeType in your product,
            and you care about continuing support and further
            development, please contribute to my funding effort so I
            can continue to bring the best text rendering to your
            devices!</p>

          <p>Besides user support and fixing bugs, your money will
            help me implement
            the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-WOFF-20121213/">WOFF</a>
            font format and extending FreeType's auto-hinter to
            support more scripts, together with other issues as
            outlined in
            the <a href="https://pledgie.com/campaigns/18808">roadmap</a>.</p>

            <li>experimental support for TrueType subpixel hinting
              support, as documented in
