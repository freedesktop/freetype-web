          <p>The FreeType project has successfully participated at
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/">Google
              Summer of Code</a>.  Here is our ideas list for future
            years – if you have another one, please write to
            our <a href="mailto:freetype-devel@nongnu.org">mailing
              list</a> so that we can discuss your suggestions,
            eventually adding them to this page.</p>

          <p>If you are interested to participate as a student, please
            also contact us via
            the <a href="mailto:freetype-devel@nongnu.org">mailing
              list</a>.  It's probably best if
            you <a href="https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/freetype-devel">subscribe</a>
            to it.</p>

          <p class="warning">Before contacting us, however, you should
            get <em>really</em> acquainted with the topic you would
            like to start with – in particular, search
            the <a href="https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/freetype-devel/">mailing
              list archive</a> and/or do some googling!  We don't want
            to answer questions like &ldquo;I'm interested in your

            do!&rdquo; again and again&hellip;</p>

          <dl>
            <dt>Develop a test framework for checking FreeType's
              rendering output</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Right now, FreeType's rendering results of the
                current development version are not systematically
                compared to a baseline version, using continuous
                integration (CI) or something similar.  This is
                problematic, since rendering regressions can be very
                easily missed due to subtle differences.</p>

              <p>However,
                a <a href="https://github.com/fundies/freetype2/tree/greg-gsoc">GSoC
                2020 project</a> now provides a good framework that
                can act as a starting point for better integration.
                In addition, we are moving to the gitlab instance
                of <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype">freedesktop.org</a>;
                this implies that access to its CI abilities should be
                straightforward.</p>

              <p>The idea is to select a representative set of
                reference fonts from font corpora (which already exist
                mainly for fuzzing).  The fonts are used to produce
                glyph images for various sizes and rendering modes
                (anti-aliased, B/W, native hinting, auto-hinting,
                etc.).  FreeType can already produce MD5 checksums of
                glyph images as part of its debugging output; these
                values should be compared against a baseline version
                of rendering results.  If there are differences, HTML
                pages should be generated that contain comparison
                images of the baseline's and the current development
                version's rendering result, ideally indicating how
                large the differences between the images are by using
                some yet to be defined measure.</p>

            <dt>Update FreeType's build systems</dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Due to historical reasons, FreeType's build systems
                are strange to newcomers.  The default one is based
                on <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/"><code>GNU
                make</code></a>, also
                integrating <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/"><code>autoconf</code></a>
                support.  Alternatives are generic build files
                for <a href="https://cmake.org/"><code>cmake</code></a>
                and <a href="https://mesonbuild.com/"><code>meson</code></a>,
                together with special support files
                for <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com">MS
                Visual
                Studio</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS">OpenVMS</a>,
                and some even more exotic, old platforms.</p>

              <p>This project is intended to update the build systems.
                Here is a preliminary list of tasks.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Investigate which build systems should be
                  retained, modified, added, removed, etc.,
                  approaching the project with a conservative point of
                  view.  This needs intensive contact with the mailing
                  list(s) to identify the needs of users and the
                  preferences of developers.  Right now, we tend to
                  move to <code>meson</code>.</li>

                <li>Check software distributions for different
                  platforms and analyze how FreeType's build systems
                  are modified for integration.  This might give
                  further hints on necessary changes or
                  adaptations.</li>

                <li>Especially for <code>cmake</code> support, there
                  are a bunch of issues
                  in <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/groups/freetype/-/issues">Freetype's
                  bug tracker</a> that should be taken care of.</li>

                <li>Modernize and update the build system based on the
                  outcome of the previous items.  This might also
                  include changes in the directory structure of the
                  source files if necessary and useful.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><em>Difficulty:</em> medium.  <em>Requirements:</em>
                Various Unix and Windows build tools, in
                particular <code>GNU make</code>,
                <code>cmake</code>,
                and <code>meson</code>.  <em>Potential mentors:</em>

            <dt>Port the <code>font-rs</code>/<code>fontdue</code>
              rendering engine to FreeType</dt>

            <dd>
              <p>Raph Levien has
                developed <a href="https://github.com/raphlinus/font-rs"><code>font-rs</code></a>,
                an experimental font renderer written in
                the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust
                programming language</a>.
                A <a href="https://medium.com/@raphlinus/inside-the-fastest-font-renderer-in-the-world-75ae5270c445">blogpost</a>
                describes some of its features in more detail; of
                particular interest is that it is much faster than
                FreeType's anti-aliasing rendering module.</p>

              <p>Note that
                the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/fontdue"><code>fontdue</code></a>
                Rust package is another rendering engine based
                on <code>font-rs</code>, and it claims to be even
                faster.  You can find some additional
                discussion <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ilnd41/fontdue_the_fastest_font_renderer_in_the_world">here</a>.

              <p>The gist of this project would be to port the Rust
                code to&nbsp;C and to integrate it into FreeType,
                providing it as an alternative rendering engine that
                eventually might replace the old one.  It would be
                necessary to investigate how this can be done, and
                whether it is feasible at all.  In case a port doesn't
                make sense (for whatever reasons) it should be
                investigated whether the ideas of the code can be used
                to re-implement the rasterizer in&nbsp;C.</p>

              <p><em>Difficulty:</em> medium (if porting) to high (if
                reimplementing).  <em>Requirements:</em> Rust, C, Unix

            <dt>Improve the &lsquo;ftinspect&rsquo; demo program
            (started as a GSoC 2019 project, unfinished)</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Right now, FreeType comes with a suite of small
                graphic tools to test the library, most notably
                &lsquo;ftview&rsquo; and &lsquo;ftgrid&rsquo;.  The
                used graphics library, while working more or less, is
                very archaic, not having any comfort that modern GUIs
                are providing.</p>

              <p>To improve this, a new demo program called
                &lsquo;ftinspect&rsquo; was started, based on the Qt
                GUI toolkit.  However, the development is currently
                stalled, mainly for lack of time.</p>

              <p>The idea is to finish ftinspect,
                handling <em>all</em> aspects of the other demo
                programs.  Currently, it only provides the
                functionality of &lsquo;ftgrid&rsquo;.</p>

              <p>If the student prefers, the Qt toolkit could be
                replaced with GTK.<p>

              <p><em>Difficulty:</em> medium.  <em>Requirements:</em>
                C, C++, Qt, Unix build tools.  <em>Potential
                mentor:</em> Werner Lemberg (FreeType).</p>

            <dt>Add a &lsquo;capability database&rsquo; to FreeType's
              auto-hinter</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>At smaller sizes, usually in the range 12ppem to
                20ppem, it can happen that separate outlines of glyphs
                touch each other (mainly caused by rounding issues),
                making glyphs illegible.  A typical example is glyph
                &lsquo;i&rsquo;, where the vertical space between the
                i-dot and the body must have a certain size to let the
                reader's eye separate the two parts.  [Note that the
                auto-hinter's capability to hint glyphs smaller than
                12ppem is very limited in general and thus not part of
                this project description.]</p>

              <p>Another example is the tilde accent, &lsquo;~&rsquo;,
                used in languages like Spanish: Even at smaller sizes
                the wiggle of the accent shape must be prevented,
                otherwise it can happen that a character like
                &lsquo;ã&rsquo; looks like &lsquo;ā&rsquo;.</p>

              <p>There are numerous other cases where some knowledge
                of the shape of a given glyph might help the
                auto-hinter improve the hinting, irrespective of the
                font shape or family – the i-dot and its body must be
                separate for virtually all available fonts.</p>

              <p>The project consists of the following parts.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Identify hinting problems of the auto-hinter
                  related to shape distortion and accent positioning.
                  A good starting point is
                  the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/groups/freetype/-/issues">FreeType
                  bug database.</a></li>

                <li>Collect necessary adjustments.  For the above two
                  examples, it would be necessary (a) to tell the
                  auto-hinter that there must be a certain vertical
                  distance between the body and its accent, and (b) to
                  distort some glyph shapes intentionally so that
                  rasterization at small ppem values gives decent
                  results.</li>

                <li>Invent a database format (to be compiled into the
                  library) that describes the necessary actions.
                  Basically, this would be a key-value table, where
                  the key is the Unicode character code of the
                  affected glyph, and the value is a list of necessary
                  actions.</li>

                <li>Add a mechanism to the auto-hinter to read the
                  database, and to apply the action (shift, distort,
                  whatever) to the affected glyph outlines if
                  necessary.  This last feature is the non-trivial
                  part of this project.</li>
              </ul>

              <p><em>Difficulty:</em> medium to
                high.  <em>Requirements:</em> C, and ideally some
                basic font hinting and rasterization

            <dt>Integrate VFlib's TeX font support into FreeType</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>A <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype/freetype/-/tree/GSoC-2018-parth">GSoC
                  2018 project</a> was a first try to integrate
                <a href="http://www-masu.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/~kakugawa/VFlib/">VFLib</a>
                into FreeType.  This library contains mature support
                for TeX's bitmap formats (in
                particular <code>GF</code> and <code>PK</code> fonts,
                together with <code>TFM</code> metric files
                and <code>VF</code> virtual fonts).</p>

              <p>The project would be as follows.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Evaluate the existing code to find out whether it
                  can be used as a starting point to complete the
                  begun task, this is, to merge VFlib's source code
                  into FreeType, thus providing new modules to handle
                  TeX bitmap fonts.</li>

                <li>Evaluate different routes if necessary.  For
                  example, it might be easier to provide simple and
                  small wrapper modules that call VFlib functions.  In
                  other words, this wouldn't integrate the code of
                  VFlib but have it as an external dependency.</li>

                <li>Create modules.</li>
